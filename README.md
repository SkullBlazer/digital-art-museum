This is a Digital Art Museum that allows users to view Digital Art by paying a fee set by the artist. All of the money paid by the viewer will be given to the artist.

##We do not take any of the proceeds.

This project was created for the 48-hour Hackathon, HacKnight, by the Hackclub at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.
This was made to shed light to the artists that get paid barely any money for their hard work, as they have to pay huge royalty fees to the companies publishing their artwork.
